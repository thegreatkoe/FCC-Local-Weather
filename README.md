# FCC-Local-Weather

A FreeCodeCamp project. 
The Task tackled in this project is to build a "local weather app".
The Webpage should display the current weather (togehter with a fitting picture or icon) depending on the users location. 
In addition the User should be able to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
